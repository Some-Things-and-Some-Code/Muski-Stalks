"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."
"I do think there is a lot of potential if you have a compelling product and people are willing to pay a premium for that. I think that is what Apple has shown. You can buy a much cheaper cell phone or laptop, but Apples product is so much better than the alternative, and people are willing to pay that premium."
What makes innovative thinking happen? I think its really a mindset. You have to decide.

The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.
"WhenHenry Ford made cheap, reliable cars, people said, Nah, whats wrong with a horse? That was a huge bet he made, and it worked."
My biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someones talent and not someones personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.
"I wouldn't say I have a lack of fear. In fact, Id like my fear emotion to be less because its very distracting and fries my nervous system."
"If something has to be designed and invented, and you have to figure out how to ensure that the value of the thing you create is greater than the cost of the inputs, then that is probably my core skill."

"I think its very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better."
"I think the best way to attract venture capital is to try and come up with a demonstration of whatever product or service it is and ideally take that as far as you can. Just see if you can sell that to real customers and start generating some momentum. The further along you can get with that, the more likely you are to get funding."
"I dont believe in process. In fact, when I interview a potential employee and he or she says that it's all about the process, I see that as a bad sign. The problem is that at a lot of big companies, process becomes a substitute for thinking. You're encouraged to behave like a little gear in a complex machine. Frankly, it allows you to keep people who arent that smart,who arent that creative."
"Some people dont like change, but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster."
I dont spend my time pontificating about high-concept things; I spend my time solving engineering and manufacturing problems.
People should pursue what they're passionate about. That will make them happier than pretty much anything else.
"As much as possible,avoid hiring MBAs. MBA programs dont teach people how to create companies."

"Its very important to like the people you work with, otherwise life [and] your job is gonna be quite miserable."
"Brand is just a perception, and perception will match reality over time. Sometimes it will be ahead, other times it will be behind. But brand is simply a collective impression some have about a product."
There are really two things that have to occur in order for a new technology to be affordable to the mass market. One is you need economies of scale. The other is you need to iterate on the design. You need to go through a few versions.
"When somebody has a breakthrough innovation, it is rarely one little thing. Very rarely, is it one little thing. Its usually a whole bunch of things that collectively amount to a huge innovation."
Persistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.
"I dont create companies for the sake of creating companies, but to get things done."
"If you're trying to create a company, its like baking a cake. You have to have all the ingredients in the right proportion."
"I always have optimism, but Im realistic. It was not with the expectation of great success that I started Tesla or SpaceX Its just thatI thought they were important enough to do anyway."
"It is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who dont know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive."
"Work like hell. I mean you just have to put in 80 to 100 hour weeks every week. [This]improves the odds of success. If other people are putting in 40 hour workweeks and you're putting in 100 hour workweeks, then even if you're doing the same thing, you know that you will achieve in four months what it takes them a year to achieve."
"You have to say, Well,why did it succeed where others did not?'"
Theres a tremendous bias against taking risks. Everyone is trying to optimize their ass-covering.

"Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough."
I always invest my own money in the companies that I create. I dont believe in the whole thing of just using other peoples money. I dont think that's right. Im not going to ask other people to invest in something if Im not prepared to do so myself.
Being an entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death.
"Dont delude yourself into thinking somethings working when its not, or you're gonna get fixated on a bad solution."
"If you're co-founder or CEO, you have to do all kinds of tasks you might not want to do If you dont do your chores, the company wont succeed No task is too menial."
"Really pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it, particularly from friends.  Hardly anyone does that, and its incredibly helpful."
We have a strict no-assholes policy at SpaceX.
I dont think its a good idea to plan to sell a company.
"Talent is extremely important. Its like a sports team, the team that has the best individual player will often win, but then theres a multiplier from how those players work together and the strategy they employ."
You shouldn't do things differently just because they're different. They need to be better.
